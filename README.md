# Autopilot Testbed

https://founderio.itch.io/autopilot-testbed

## Requirements
This game requires OpenGL 3.3+ to run.
On Windows, make sure you have a supported graphics card with up-to-date drivers. Some drivers (especially for virtual machines) do not support the required OpenGL version.

## Save Files
* On Linux: %HOME%/.local/share/autopilot_testbed
* On macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/net.founderio.autopilot_testbed
* On Windows: %APPDATA%\autopilot_testbed

## Example car
To load the example car, copy the file to the save file directory and name it somewhere between `save_0.toml` and `save_4.toml`.
It will then show up as a saved car in the menu.
